\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

% Context
% (a) hay que arrancar introduciendo nuestra visión, contando por qué enseñamos objetos de determinada manera, por qué hicimos Ozono/Wollok.

% La importancia de arrancar con objetos.
%\emph{Object-oriented programming} (OOP) has become the \textit{de facto} standard programming paradigm in industrial software development.
%Therefore, in the last years software engineering curricula have put more emphasis in object-oriented courses.

% Problem: aprender a programar es difícil
Teaching how to program has revealed itself a difficult task~\cite{dijkstra_89a, jenkins2002difficulty}.
We have individualized three specific aspects present in many initial programming courses that hinder the learning process: 
(a) a complex programming language,
(b) too many concepts needed for a first working program and
(c) programming environment that are not conceived for the specific needs of an initial student~\cite{singh2012}.

%First, OO courses tend to focus too much on syntax and the particular characteristics of a language, instead of focusing on OOP distinctive characteristics.
%Second, many OO languages used in introductory courses do require to grasp a lot of quite abstract concepts before being able to build a first program.
%Finally, poor programming environments are used, although we are at a time where an unexperienced programmer could be making great use of the guidance a good programming environment could provide. These problems are not exclusive of OO courses, they are present in all the general programming courses.

% Factual solution tracks, to position...
The great differences between these programming languages and environments show that they have to be analysed in the light of the pedagogical approaches behind them.
%The tools are of little use without their respective pedagogical view.
We follow the work of Lombardi \etal
\cite{lombardi_instances_2007,lombardi_carlos_alumnos_2008,spigariol_lucas_ensenando_2013,passerini2017wollok}, 
which consists on a novel path to introduce OO concepts focusing first on objects, messages and polymorphism 
while delaying the introduction of more abstract concepts,
such as classes, types or inheritance.
This way of organizing a course provides a more gentle learning curve to students and allows them to write completely working programs from the first classes.

Also, this approach gives great importance to the programming tools used in the course, 
stating that they should be carefully selected and customized, 
taking into account the specific needs of beginner programmers,
as well as the intended pedagogical view.
These ideas led us to conceive a programming language, named Wollok,
together with am Integrated Development Environment (the Wollok \emph{IDE}).

The main goal of this paper is to describe how the set of tools included in the Wollok IDE%
\footnote{

	Source code and documentation can be found in Github 
	(\url{https://github.com/uqbar-project/wollok}).

	(\url{http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html}).}
contribute to support a gentle and industry-aware introduction to OOP.

% What our solution is, so that the reader knows where the paper is going.
% Contribution of the paper

%Wollok combines some characteristics that are typically present in academical environments with others that are more easily seen in industrial ones, aiming to enrich them to fulfill the specific needs of novice programmers and the proper development of a first OOP course.
%Its most noticeable characteristics are:
%(1) the possibility of using self-defined objects to support an introduction to the topic that postpones the introduction of the concept of class,
%(2) the possibility of combining self-defined with class-based code objects in the same program,
%(3) the decission of offering an IDE with edition and code management capabilities that are fine-tuned for unexperienced programmers
%and (4) that both the language as the IDE share similarities with their industrial counterparts, in order to soften the later transition to the professional tools.

% Paper structure
%The rest of the paper is structured as follows. 
In \secref{problem} we present the problems of learning Object Oriented programming
together with a brief introduction to our pedagogical approach. 
\secref{methodology} describes the iterative methodology 
used for the development of our pedagogical approach 
and the tools that support it,
while \secref{environment} describes some characteristics of these tools
and their role for teaching programming skills.
\secref{results} describes the results obtained.
\secref{discussion} analyses some key design decisions
%, while \secref{related} compares our solution with another similar approaches. 
and \secref{conclusion} summarises our contributions
along with some possible lines of further work.
%As an appendix we have Sections \ref{sec:implementation}, \ref{sec:wollokSoftware} and \ref{sec:ChecksAndValidations} which give more details about the implementation.
