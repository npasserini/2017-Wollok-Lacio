% Primero hablar de lenguajes específicos para enseñar
There have been several proposals to address the difficulties in introductory OO courses 
by defining a specific language which provides a simplified programming model,
such as Karel++~\cite{bergin_karel++:_1996} and Mama~\cite{harrisonmama}.
This approach has been used even outside the OO world \cite{feurzeig_programming-languages_1970, pattis_karel_1981, lopez_nombre_2012}.
% Environments
A step further is to provide a whole programming environment specifically designed to aid novice programmers 
such as Squeak \cite{ingalls_back_1997}, 
Traffic \cite{broy_outside-method_2003},
Loop \cite{griggio_programming_2011}, 
and BlueJ \cite{bennedsen_bluej_2010}.

Other environments make use of block-based or visual programming, 
such as Scratch \cite{malan_scratch_2007}, Etoys \cite{lee_empowering_2011} and Kodu \cite{kodu}. 
In our vision, these tools are suitable for stimulating interest in programming and for being used in secondary education, but not beyond that stage.
Other approaches, such as Gobstones \cite{lopez_nombre_2012}, focus on a first universitary programming course%
\cl{ver si el artículo sobre Gobstones tiene related work}.
Other educators propose to use industrial languages in introductory courses, 
such as Java \cite{kolling2001guidelines}, Eiffel \cite{meyer1993towards, broy_outside-method_2003}, Smalltalk \cite{ducasse2006squeak} and Self \cite{Unga87a}.
%Self, at the same time, has pioneered in allowing for OOP without classes.
