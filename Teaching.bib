	abstract = {This paper describes the features that a programming environment should have in order to help learning the object-oriented programming ({OOP}) paradigm and let students get the skills needed to build software using objects very quickly. This proposal is centered on providing graphical tools to help understand the concepts of the paradigm and let students create objects before they are presented the class concept [14]. The object, message and reference concepts are considered of primary importance during the teaching process, allowing quick acquisition of both theory and practice of concepts such as delegation, polymorphism and composition [7]. Additionally, a current implementation of the proposed software and the experience gained so far using it for teaching at universities and work trainings. Finally, we describe possible extensions to the proposed software that are currently under study.},

	title = {Instances and Classes in the Introduction  of Object Oriented Programming},
	abstract = {This paper discusses some ideas related to the introduction of the 
object oriented programming paradigm to students with previous 
knowledge about programming in a procedural style, making 
focus on the difficulties arisen when working with the concepts of 
class and instance. First, the order of topic presentation is altered 
delaying the appearance of the class concept. Then, the usage of 
an instance-based programming environment, lacking the concept 
of class, constructed over Dolphin Smalltalk is analyzed. Finally, 
results are described which show that students are able to do more 
complex exercises, to improve the relationship between theory 
and practice and to have a better overall comprehension of the 
main ideas of the paradigm.},

programming. Still, their lack of type information hampers
program understanding and limits the possibilities of programming tools such as automatic refactorings, automated
testing framework, and program navigation. In this paper
we present an extensible constraint-based type inference algorithm for object-oriented dynamic languages, focused on
providing type information which is useful for programming tools. The algorithm is able to infer types for small
industrial-like programs, including advanced features like
blocks and generic types. Although it is still an early version, its highly extensible and configurable structure make
our solution a useful test bench for further investigation.},
